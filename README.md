# merDeriv

merDeriv is a free, open source R package for computing derivatives of mixed models estimated via lme4. Allows users to compute scores (casewise/clusterwise first derivatives of likelihood function) and variance-covariance matrix of all estimated parameters, including random effect (co)variances.
